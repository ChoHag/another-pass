This is a total rip off of Jason Donenfeld's password manager at
http://zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/. It uses the same ideas in basically
the same way. In fact the only reason this isn't pass version n+1 is that I
started writing a few extra features, then wrote a few more bits, then found
that I already had a mostly complete piece of software, so I finished it.

Another Pass is a unix password manager with the following features:
  * No documentation
  * All encryption and decryption is performed by GPG
    * Unsafe temporary storage is not used for unencrypted data without user
      confirmation
    * GPG gets/has to deal with requesting and retaining all secret data
  * Optional revision control with git
  * Unix tool in the traditional manner:
    * Data stored in plain files
    * Structure provided by filesystem directories
    * Designed for pipelines
    * Does one thing
    * Does it well
    * Output formatting for humans, machines and hybrids
  * Multiple encryption destinations per store, directory and/or password
  * Encrypted files can be signed
    * NB. Verification is not performed in any guise
  * Password generation
  * Audit trail
  * Simple, extensible API
  * Deal with multiple passwords simultaneously

Features it will soon have because they're not that hard:
  * Some documentation
  * Copy to clipboard
  * Better portability
  * Ascii armoured files
  * Separate API & CLI

Features that might be a bit harder:
  * Good documentation
  * Adaptable password generation
  * Front ends
  * Encrypted filenames/directories. If you need it, try encfs.
